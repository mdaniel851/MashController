Thermodynamics of Mashing

Hm = heat capacity of malt = 0.3822 Btu/lb. °F
Hw = heat capacity of water = 1 Btu/lb. °F
Tmt= temp. of dry malt, °F
Tw = temp. of water, °F
Tma= temp. of mash, °F
M = weight of malt, lbs.
W = weight of water, lbs.
(1 gallon water = approx. 8.3 lbs.)

The equation:

W x Hw x (Tw-Tma) = M x Hm x (Tma-Tmt) 

mass * H * dT = 

Unit Analsys

lb * Btu/lb deg F * deg F = Btu (Energy)
